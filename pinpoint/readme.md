Controller API ( inherits ROS Driver Capabilities )
-------------------
### Parameters
~address (string, default: "192.168.0.5")
: ipv4 address for PinPoint localization server

~loc_port (string, default: "9501")
: port for localization server

~odom_frame (string, default: "odom")
: continuous local frame of robot

~base_link_frame (string, default: "base_link")
### Published Topics
sent_messages ( can_msgs/Frame )
> CAN frames sent to vehicle dbw module, this should be advertised by a a node communicating with CAN hardware

~control/robot_status (cav_msgs/RobotEnabled )
> publishes the Robot status of the controller driver, robotic_active is set when the SRX Module reports active control, robot_enabled is set when the robotic_enabled flag is set through the enable_robotic service

/diagnostics (diagnostic_msgs/DiagnosticArray)
> This driver uses the diagnostic_updater API to publish diagnostic statuses to the /diagnostic topic.

### Subscribed Topics
received_messages ( can_msgs/Frame )
> We listen to this topic for messages from the dbw module

~/control/cmd_speed (cav_msgs/SpeedAccel )
> Messages received on this topic are converted to closed loop speed commands to the sent_messages topic. The units used are m/s and m/s^2.

~/control/cmd_longitudinal_effort
> Messages received on this topic are converted to open loop effort commands sent to the sent_messages topic. The effort is bounded [-100,100].

### Services
~control/set_lights (cav_msgs/SetLights.srv)
> Set the state of the light bar

~control/get_lights (cav_msgs/GetLights.srv)
> Get the light status of the set value of the light bars. (NOTE: this may not match up with the physical lights if there is a communication disconnect)

~control/enable_robotic (cav_msgs/SetEnableRobotic)
> This service allows another node to set/unset the robot_enabled flag. If the robot_enabled flag is set to false all messages received on the cmd_speed and cmd_longitudinal_effort topicss of this node are ignored. The controller will send disable robotic commands down to the hardware. The status of this robot_enabled flag is publisshed in the robot_status topic.


## Control Flow to command robotic

This node attempts to abstract away the requirements of the underlying hardware and reduce commanding speeds/efforts to the API specified in this document. For the sake of having this 
as a reference somewhere the following procedure is required to enter robotic mode in the 2013 SRX with the CARMA hardware.

1. Turn on Electronics
2. Turn on Ignition
3. Launch ROS software ( this should include the srx_controller_node assuming enabled_at_start is set to false) 
4. Prime the SRX 2013 ACC by accelerating > 25mph and entering ACC
5. Call the ~/control/enable_robotic service with set = true
	This will allow the srx_controller_node to forward commands received
6. Begin commanding speed/effort at greater than 5Hz ( < 200ms delay )
7. Driver must then manually enter robotic by double tapping the ACC set button.

From this point on the vehicle will remain in robotic as long as it receives commands @ >5z, the robot_enabled flag remains set to true, and there is no manual override. If a process wishes to remain in robotic but not command effort it should send cmd_longitudinal_efforts of 0% @ >5hz
